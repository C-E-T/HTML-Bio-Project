        <h3>Bowling</h3>

        <p>One of Cody's favorite hobbies is <b>Bowling</b>, he has been bowling competitively for 12 years now 
            starting when he was nine years old in a youth league. He then continued in that youth league and is 
            currently still throwing in it, but also decided to join a second youth league at the age of <i>twelve</i>. 
            Then at the age of <i>seventeen</i> he decided to join an adult league as well bowling against bowlers of ages <i>sixteen</i> and above 
            at a higher level of competition. At his prime he was averaging around <b>190</b> and continues to average
            around <b>180</b>.
        </p>

        <h3>Gaming</h3>

        <p>Cody's gaming hobby is one that gets him in trouble as he tends to prioritize video games over work at
            times. He enjoys a variety of games including <i>FPS, Simulation, Puzzle Games< MOBA's, and Mobile Games</i>.
            While gaming is a great hobby and stress reliever a <b>balance</b> between studying and gaming needs to be found by Cody for him to succeed.
        </p>

        <h3>Acting</h3>

        <p> A more <i>creative</i> hobby Cody has is acting. Ever since his first role in <i>The Nifty Fifties</i> at the age of <b>twelve</b> 
            he knew he was born to be on a stage. Cody then tried out for every subsequent school play after that, some other roles he had are <i>Beast in 
            Beauty and the Beast, Multiple different characters in Greek Olypiaganza, and a sailor in the Mayor of Casterbridge</i>. Now those are just 
            his role in school productions, in grade 10 drama class he met a fellow classmate who was part of a youth theater group outside of the school
            and they invited Cody to try out for their upcoming show <i>Peter, Wendy</i>. So Cody went to auditions and landed the role of <i>MR.Darling</i>. 
            From then on he continued acting in shows with this company, Revolution Youth Theater, his roles in their other shows included, <i>Dracula in 
            Dracula Spectacula, multiple roles in Real Life, and Backstage for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>. I think its easy to see that Cody likes \
            to be on stage.
        </p>

        <h3>Handy-Work</h3>

        <p>
            A more practical hobby Cody has is <i>Handy-Work</i>. From doing small house repairs to working as a roofer and a mechanic at a bowling alley, Cody is no stranger to handy work.
            He learned all his skills from his <i>GrandFather</i> who used to build houses for a living and even built the house his grandparents live in currently.
            Cody loved working with his hands and spent hours taking things apart as a kid, he never quite learned how to put them back together tho. Once Cody bought his 
            first car he saw it as a blank canvas and a new project and spent hours doing small modifications to the interior and audio systems to <b>Pimp it out!!</b>
            He is currently putting these skills to work as a roofer while he is studying, but hopes to not need these skills for much longer since this line of work
            puts a huge toll on his body.
