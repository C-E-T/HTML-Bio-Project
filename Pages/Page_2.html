        <h3>Where to begin?</h3>

        <p>One of Cody's favorite hobbies is <b>Coding</b>, he loves it so much he has decided to pursue a course of study in coding, specifically
           networking, and continues to learn new things when he has free time. Cody's interest in coding started at age <i>fourteen</i> when he got 
           bored of the video games he owned and decided he was going to make his own. After doing some research he decided it was <b>way too complicated</b>
           and set that in the back of his mind for now. The year after he took a coding course at his highschool where they learned <b>Python</b>. He loved the 
           graphics portion of that class and decided to take the grade twelve class the following year. In that class they were taught <b>Java</b>, this is where
           Cody struggled a bit and it deterred him away from coding, unfortunately a combination of butting heads with the teacher and stress caused 
           disinterest in coding and Cody decided his future was in science instead, but there was still a small voice in the back of his head telling him to pursue coding.
        </p>

        <h3>Post Secondary Studies</h3>

        <p>When Cody moved on to post secondary studies he decided he was going to major in <i>Bio-Technology></i>, but decided to take computer science as a minor.
            This is where he fell back in love with coding, his first year of university coding was in <b>Java</b> again and he found that he was a lot better at it 
            this time and it restored his love for it. He then decided to switch majors to <i>Computer Science</i>. He decided to make this change too late tho 
            his first year marks came back to haunt him and he ended up dropping out of university and decided to study <i>Computer Networking</i> at College.
        </p>

        <h3>Current Studies</h3>

        <p>Now Cody is studying <i>Computer Networking</i> and is loving it, he has finally found his calling and is excited for his future. He enjoys
           learning <b>Web Development, Networking, and Programing Logic</b>, he is not enjoying the math or excel course he is required to take but 
           knows they are useful courses non the less.
        </p>

        <h3>Future Plans</h3>

        <p>In his free time Cody enjoys teaching himself new languages, including <b> PHP, SQL, Swift </b> and many more. This drive allowed him 
           to get a jump on classmates when studying, since he has taught himself some of the languages he uses in class and allows him to help hsi class mates
           with their learning or allows him to focus on his other courses more since he already knows the coding ones. This can pose a problem sometimes
           tho, as Cody tends to use some more advanced techniques that his professors might not have taught yet and they might not allow it in his projects.
           Since he is also teaching himself more advanced languages at the same time sometimes they get crossed and mixed up in his brain and he tries writing
           a comment using <b>Java</b> syntax in <b>HTML</b> code, which will cause him a few errors.
        </p>

        <p>Although Cody is still studying and dose not work in his field yet, he still likes to share and publish his projects for others to see and 
           critique. Cody's projects can be found on his <i>Github page</i>, which is linked above. Some of his current <i>work-in-progresses</i> are a website for 
           the theater company he participates in, a website for game development, a PHP website, and of course the one you are currently viewing, although 
           at the time you are viewing it, it will be complete, <b>hopefully</b>.
        </p>

        <p>This is just the start of Cody's coding career, he plans on making a living out of this <b>passion</b> and will continue learning 
           every chance he gets he plans on teaching himself new languages as he has time and wants to one day have a remote job managing a network of
           a company so he can spend time at home as a <i>family man</i>, or spend time out at sea <i>travelling</i> and enjoying life.
